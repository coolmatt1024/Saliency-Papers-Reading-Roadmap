# Saliency-Papers-Reading-Roadmap
Here are some papers about saliency. 

I divide papers into five parts.

The architecture: Many methods to predict where human looks,including the traditional method and the deep learning method.

The Applicationï¼šWhere we can use saliency models.

The Brain: Try to explian the brain mechanism of selective attention.

Metrics: How to eveluate the model.

CVPR2016: A good introduction of saliency prediction.

There are still some parts I want to add, but I don't have much time so wait me for a year and I will try to finish the repository.
