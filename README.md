# Saliency-Papers-Reading-Roadmap
**Here are some papers about saliency. **

[Applications][1]ï¼šWhere we can use saliency models.

[Architecture][2]: Many methods to predict where human looks,including the traditional method(not added) and the deep learning method.

[Benchmark][3]: Some important contents in MIT Saliency Benchmark and SALICON Challenge(unfinished)

[Brain][4]: Try to explian the brain mechanism of selective attention.

[Metric][5]: How to eveluate the model.

[CNN][6]: Some instructive papers about CNN architectures,visualization and understanding.


*There are still some parts I want to add, but I don't have much time so wait me for some time and I will try to finish the repository.*
